## ESP32 USB example code

Demonstrates the Espressif's USB example fails in the same way as my code.  This is why I gave up on the ESP-IDF USB solution and switch to Arduino version in next commit.

1. Clone [https://github.com/espressif/esp-iot-solution](https://github.com/espressif/esp-iot-solution)
2. `cd esp-iot-solution`
3. Build and run, same as other ESP-IDF repo. Get same error at runtime on the device and no keystrokes are emitted.
